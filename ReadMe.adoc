= Project: {SerialToSerialBT}

This project connects to a BT device and sends and receives data
It can also control the INBUILT_LED
The code needs to receive text to control the LED
Send Led On, Led Off, Toggle to the ESP32 to control the LED

== Boards: Verified Boards
This code works with:-
ESP32 WROOM

This code should work with all ESP32-based boards

== Configurations
The INBUILT attribute may be different on other baord typre
The ESP32 WROOM uses the WiFi module to control on-board LEDS. Ensure WifiNINA library is included

== Step 1: Code Installation
Upload the code to the ESP32 by connecting a USB cable between the device and Project
When the PC is attempting to connect you may need to press the BOOT button a number of times
Once the downloas starts the button can be released

== Step 2: Android App Installation
Load the Android App Serial Bluetooth App

== Step 3: Condigure the App
The app has a row of function buttons that you will need to reconfigure
[M1][M2][M3][M4][M5][M6]
Long press on a function key and change the... 
Name to Led On and the Value to Led On and press tick
Name to Led Off and Value to Led Off and press tick
Name to Toggle and Value to Toggle and press tick

== Step 4: function
Press the new function keys to send the data to the PC
The code will turn on and off the LED and print to the monitor

== Step 5: Assemble the circuit

No assembly required
